# SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE

**THE SUMMARY OF A 10 PAGE PDF ON SOFTWARE DESIGN GUIDE BY ARJAN CODES AS REQUESTED FROM OsMaxin**

Software design is the systematic development of software components such as methods, functions, objects, and overall code structure to effectively meet user requirements. The Design Guide encompasses the principles implemented to ensure user-friendly software.

Before diving into building software or implementing a feature, it's advisable to follow the best practices outlined by the author of the PDF document.

**ABOUT:**

Understanding the software you're working on is crucial for several reasons. Firstly, it helps you grasp the project requirements and the problems it's meant to solve, making it easier to collaborate with your team and make informed decisions. Additionally, knowing the software well enables you to work more efficiently, addressing issues and implementing improvements faster. Ultimately, the goal is to ensure that the software functions effectively and meets its intended purpose. Therefore, it's essential to think broadly about the software and what it entails.

**USER INTERFACE:**

The definition of software design emphasizes that software should meet the user's requirements. Therefore, when building software, prioritizing a user-centric approach is crucial, meaning you should keep the user in mind throughout the design process. It's essential to ensure that what you design makes sense to the user. In some cases, this might require introducing additional concepts to clarify how the system works.

**TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION:**

Technical specification is a detailed instruction manual for building software. It is important to understand the specific requirements, materials, dimensions, and functionalities that are needed to create the final product.

**TESTING AND SECURITY:**

Testing helps you find bugs and produce better, more reliable code. To write better and reliable codes, you have to develop a tester’s mindset. A mindset that every piece of code can potentially break something. If you adopt this mindset, you’ll start to automatically organize your code such that edge cases are handled almost automatically. Design interfaces, classes, and methods in such a way that they nudge the users into following the happy flow.

**DEPLOYMENT:**

_Before deployment, a programmer ought to ask him/herself:_

- Are there any architectural or DevOps changes needed?
- Are there any migration scripts that need to be written?

These questions are required to avoid deployment issues.

**PLANNING:**

Effective planning involves identifying main risk factors, exploring alternative routes if initial plans encounter obstacles, determining essential components versus optional features, and implementing the project in phased stages. By breaking down the project into manageable phases, prioritizing tasks, and continuously evaluating progress, the software development process becomes more structured and adaptable, ensuring resilience to unforeseen challenges while maintaining focus on essential goals.

**BROADER CONTEXT:**

It's essential to recognize the limitations of the current design and consider potential future extensions. Additionally, embracing "moonshot" ideas can lead to unexpected insights and innovations during development. This open-minded approach fosters creativity and enhances the software's value.
